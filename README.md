👋 Hi, I’m Cody!

- I'm a Cloud Engineer ☁️🖥️ currently working at Textron Inc, and an alumni at Texas A&M University. WHOOP! 👍🏽
- 👀 I’m interested in developing CI/CD pipelines with DevOps and anything to do with automation or Infrastructure as Code 🤖
- 🌱 I’m currently working mainly with Powershell and some bash, but looking to get into more languages like Python 🐍 or Scala  (stay tuned for a personal project...)

When I'm not working, I love to:
- 🚴 Bike
- 🎿 Ski (when in season)
- 🥾 Hike (also when in season)
- 🚣🏿‍♀️ Paddleboard
- 🕹️ PC Gaming
- ✈️ Travel
- 👨‍💻 Learn about new technologies (I have a unique interest in 🚀 rocketry and 💻cyber)
