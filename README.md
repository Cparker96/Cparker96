👋 Hi, I’m Cody!

- I'm a Ground Software Developer ☁️🖥️ currently working at AST SpaceMobile, and an alumni at Texas A&M University :+1:
- 👀 I’m interested in API development and/or anything to do with automation/Infrastructure as Code in a cloud environment 🤖 
- 🌱 I’m currently working mainly with python and FastAPI 🐍 (stay tuned for a personal project...) alongside Terraform for the infra lifecycle, but looking to dive deeper into Golang 

When I'm not working, I love to:
- 🚴 Bike
- 🎿 Ski 
- 🥾 Hike 
- 🚣🏿‍♀️ Paddleboard
- 🕹️ Game
- :tokyo_tower: Travel
- :airplane: Fly my drone
